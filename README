# LLM4RD: LLM for Reward Design

## Briefly Introduction
### Idea: 
Originates from [Eureka](https://github.com/eureka-research/Eureka.git).
- using LLM to design reward for different kinds of sports
- in-context learning
- see details.md to know more about the project.

### Environment :
The test env is mainly on [SMPLOlympics](https://github.com/SMPLOlympics/SMPLOlympics.git)

## About the Code
`/llm4rd`ï¼š
- `llm4rd.py`: llm reward design loop 
- `/envs`: change a little from `SMPLOlympics/phc/env/tasks` (temporarily copy boxing sports), and the obs of tasks (used for in-context learning prompting)
- `/outputs`: history llm output result (using LLaMA3) 

`smpl_envs/tasks`:
- imitate the file system of `SMPLOlympics`. after other parts have been completed, this folder can be changed to the real `SMPLOlympics` file path (`SMPLOlympics/phc/env/tasks`)
