The Python environment is {task_obs_code_string}. Write a reward function for the following task: {task_description}.
Referring to the previous reward function design results for this general category of sports:{output_context_string} and
use the method of in-context learning to design an adapted reward function for a new variant of the sport.
The introduction of the new variant of the sport is {input_rules}. The output should meet the requirement and the function name id "compute_reward".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You can explore common sense as much as possible and analyze the given competition rules to identify the key factors for winning and the inherent characteristics of the sport, 
so that the reward function can motivate efficient sports combat strategies and promote the agent's long-term learning in a competitive environment. 
    (2) Ensure that the function design can balance the aforementioned factors, and each factor can explain how it affects the strategy learning process.
