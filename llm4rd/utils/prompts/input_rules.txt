Muay Thai, a martial art originating from Thailand, has the following main competition rules:
1. **Rounds**: Professional Muay Thai matches typically consist of 5 rounds, each lasting 3 minutes, with 2-minute breaks between rounds.
2. **Scoring System**: The match is won by accumulating points through effective strikes to the opponent's valid target areas, such as the head, torso, and limbs.
3. **Allowed Strikes**: Fighters can use punches, kicks, knees, and elbows.
4. **Prohibited Targets**: Strikes to the back of the head, neck, and groin are forbidden.
5. **Fouls**: Actions like headbutting, biting, holding the ropes, and intentionally striking the back of the head or neck with elbows are considered fouls.
6. **Refereeing**: There is a main referee and several corner judges who oversee the match and score it. The outcome can be a KO (knockout), TKO (technical knockout), decision by points, or a draw.
7. **Weight Classes**: Matches are usually held in weight classes to ensure fairness.
8. **Equipment**: Fighters must wear boxing gloves and can wear mouthguards, but not helmets. Their hands and feet are typically wrapped with bandages or use specific hand wraps.

Scoring in Muay Thai is based on principles such as:
1. **Powerful Strikes**: Strikes that significantly affect the opponent, like strong kicks, knees, or elbows, score the most points.
2. **Clear and Forceful Strikes**: Any clear and forceful strikes with punches, kicks, knees, or elbows to the opponent's valid areas score points.
3. **Unbalancing the Opponent**: Using leg techniques or takedowns to unbalance the opponent and following up with strong attacks can score higher points.
4. **Knocking Down**: Knocking the opponent down, especially if they need a count, scores more points. A knockdown may result in a two-point deduction.
5. **Clinch Work**: In clinches, the number and effectiveness of knee strikes are key for scoring.
6. **Takedowns**: Using allowed takedowns to bring the opponent to the ground can also score points.
7. **Defense and Counterattacks**: Successfully defending and counterattacking can score points, especially if the counterattack causes significant damage or unbalances the opponent.
8. **Aggression**: Fighters who display more aggression and take the initiative in offense can also score points.
9. **Technological Diversity**: Although not the main scoring method, showing a variety of techniques and combinations can also score points, especially when they successfully hit the opponent.
10. **Impression Points**: Judges may also award impression points to fighters who show fighting spirit and aggression, even if the strikes do not directly hit the opponent.

Overall, scoring in Muay Thai emphasizes power, accuracy, and the effectiveness of strikes, as well as the fighter's fighting style and aggression. Fighters need to use various techniques within the rules to inflict damage on their opponents to score higher points.
