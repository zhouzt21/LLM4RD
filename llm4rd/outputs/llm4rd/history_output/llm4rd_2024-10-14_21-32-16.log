The above code defines a simple yet effective reward function for the boxing environment. It has two main components: `reward_touch` and `reward_knockout`, with a small negative contribution from `time_penalty`. The `reward_touch` component encourages the boxer to touch their opponent's body during the fight, while the `reward_knockout` component gives an additional large reward for knocking out the opponent. The time penalty is used to discourage long matches.

In this code, we first calculate the difference between the boxers' hands and their opponents' bodies in the global coordinate system, which gives us a measure of how close they are to each other. We then take the norm of this difference along the z-axis (the direction perpendicular to the ground) as our reward component for touching the opponent.

The `reward_knockout` component is a binary value that is 1 if the sum of the `reward_touch` values exceeds a threshold, indicating that at least one knockout blow was delivered. This gives a large positive reward when such an event occurs.

Finally, we include a small negative time penalty to discourage long matches, normalized by an exponential decay term with a rate of 0.01 (meaning that each second costs approximately -100 points). The sum of these components gives us our overall reward value.

The `reward_dict` dictionary provides a breakdown of the individual reward components for debugging purposes. The final output is a tuple containing both the overall reward and its component-wise decomposition.
