Note: This is just an example of how you might write a reward function for this task. You can modify it based on your specific needs and requirements.

The code above calculates the distance between the boxer's hand and the opponent, counts the number of effective blows dealt by checking if this distance is less than 0.2 units, calculates the damage per second for these blows, checks if the opponent has been knocked out (based on their dof velocities being very low), calculates a time penalty based on how much time remains in the match, and combines all these rewards into one dictionary that is returned along with the total reward. The final reward is calculated as a sum of individual rewards.

This reward function provides an incentive to deliver effective blows quickly and accurately, while also penalizing the boxer for wasting time. If the opponent is knocked out, a bonus reward is awarded to the boxer. You can adjust these parameters (TIME_REWARD_PENALTY, DAMAGE_PER_SECOND, KNOCKOUT_BONUS) based on your specific needs.

Please note that this is just an example and you might need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Also, make sure the units of all input tensors match. For instance, if `self_hand_pos` and `oppo_body_pos` are in meters, then `hand_pos_diff` should be calculated as `(self_hand_pos - oppo_body_pos).abs()`. Similarly, for velocity calculations, you might need to convert them into compatible units before taking the absolute value.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Given the rules of Muay Thai, I will propose a reward function for an agent to learn efficient sports combat strategies.

The reward function should encourage the agent to:

1. **Land effective strikes**: This can be achieved by rewarding the agent for landing strikes that significantly affect the opponent (e.g., strong kicks, knees, or elbows).
2. **Show aggression and take the initiative in offense**: This can be rewarded by giving more points for aggressive actions, such as moving forward with attacks.
3. **Use technological diversity**: Rewarding combinations of techniques will encourage the agent to use various strikes, not just rely on a single approach.
4. **Defend effectively and counterattack**: When the opponent is attacking, defend well and counterattack; this should be rewarded.
5. **Knock down or unbalance the opponent**: Knocking an opponent down or using leg techniques/takedowns to unbalance them will also score more points.

These factors are key for winning in Muay Thai, as they demonstrate a fighter's strength, skill, and adaptability.

To formalize this reward function, we can use the following scheme:

$$
R = \begin{cases}
  +1 &\text{if opponent is knocked down or unbalanced} \\
  +0.5 &\text{if successful counterattack or defense} \\
  +0.2 &\text{for each effective strike landed (e.g., strong kick, knee, elbow)} \\
  +0.1 &\text{for every different technique used in a combination} \\
  -0.1 &\text{for each time the agent is knocked down or loses balance} \\
  -2 &\text{for committing fouls (e.g., headbutting, biting)}
\end{cases}
$$

This function can be adjusted based on the specific environment and simulation. For example, if the opponent's health status is a significant factor in determining the winner, then landing effective strikes could be rewarded even more.

The agent will learn to adapt its strategy by maximizing this reward function. It will focus on using strong and diverse techniques to strike the opponent while also showing aggression and defending effectively against counterattacks. The negative rewards for being knocked down or committing fouls will discourage these actions, leading the agent to develop a safer and more strategic approach.

To further enhance the learning process, we can consider additional factors such as:

1. **Rounds**: Rewarding agents who score more points in each round, with a higher reward for winning rounds decisively.
2. **Weight Classes**: Adjusting rewards based on the weight class to account for differences in strength and size between opponents.

Incorporating these nuances into the reward function will make it even more realistic and challenging for an agent to learn how to win matches in Muay Thai. By maximizing this function, agents will develop a comprehensive strategy that balances various aspects of the sport, leading to more engaging and competitive simulations.
