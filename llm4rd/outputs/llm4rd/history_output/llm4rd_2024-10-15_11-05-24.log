Here is an example of what your reward function for Muay Thai might look like:

```python
def muay_thai_reward(state):
    # Initialize a score that will be returned at the end
    total_score = 0

    # Check if the match has ended (KO, TKO or decision by points)
    if state["match_status"] in ["ko", "tko", "decision"]:
        if state["match_winner"] == state["player"]:
            return 10000 + total_score
        else:
            return -10000 - total_score

    # Check for powerful strikes (kicks, knees and elbows)
    kick_power = 0
    knee_power = 0
    elbow_power = 0
    for strike in state["strikes"]:
        if strike["type"] == "kick" and strike["power"] > 0.5:
            kick_power += strike["damage"]
        elif strike["type"] == "knee" and strike["power"] > 0.5:
            knee_power += strike["damage"]
        elif strike["type"] == "elbow" and strike["power"] > 0.5:
            elbow_power += strike["damage"]

    # Add power to the total score
    total_score += kick_power + knee_power + elbow_power

    # Check for clear and forceful strikes (punches, kicks and knees)
    punch_force = 0
    kick_force = 0
    knee_force = 0
    for strike in state["strikes"]:
        if strike["type"] == "punch" and strike["force"] > 0.5:
            punch_force += strike["damage"]
        elif strike["type"] == "kick" and strike["force"] > 0.5:
            kick_force += strike["damage"]
        elif strike["type"] == "knee" and strike["force"] > 0.5:
            knee_force += strike["damage"]

    # Add force to the total score
    total_score += punch_force + kick_force + knee_force

    # Check for takedowns (only count successful ones)
    if state["takedown_attempts"] > 0 and state["successful_takedowns"]:
        total_score += 1000

    # Check if the opponent is knocked down or unbalanced
    if state["opponent_knocked_down"] or state["opponent_unbalanced"]:
        total_score += 500

    # Check for clinch work (knee strikes)
    if state["clinch_work"]:
        total_score += 1000

    # Penalize fouls
    if state["fouls"]:
        total_score -= 1000

    # Promote aggression and defense (counterattacks)
    if state["aggressive_attempts"] > 0:
        total_score += 500
    if state["successful_counterattacks"]:
        total_score += 500

    # Penalize holding the ropes or biting
    if state["holding_rope"] or state["biting"]:
        total_score -= 1000

    return total_score
```

This is just an example, and you can modify it as per your requirement. Remember to balance the different aspects of Muay Thai combat so that they encourage efficient strategies and long-term learning in a competitive environment.
