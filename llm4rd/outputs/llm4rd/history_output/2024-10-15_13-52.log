This reward function gives a higher score to boxers that are closer to their opponents and can knock them out. Additionally, it penalizes the boxer for taking too long to deliver an effective blow or knock out their opponent. The distance reward is computed as the exponential of the negative L2 norm between the hand positions and the opponent's body position. The knock out reward is based on the velocity difference between the boxers' root states. If a knockout occurs, the total score is multiplied by the maximum knock out reward achieved. Finally, there is a small time penalty that increases as the episode progresses. The temperature parameter for each transformed component (i.e., distance and knock out rewards) can be tuned to balance their relative importance in the total reward calculation.

The code is compatible with TorchScript and meets all requirements specified in the problem statement. It takes the relevant variables from the provided environment class definition as input and returns a tuple containing the total reward and a dictionary of individual components. The temperature parameter for each transformed component is introduced, but its value must be set outside the function call. If desired, these temperatures can be tuned to balance the relative importance of different reward components in the overall score.

Please note that this code does not account for the boxers' contact with each other (e.g., hitting or being hit). This could be added as an additional component in the reward function, but it would require more information about the environment and how these interactions are defined. For simplicity, we assume that a knockout occurs when the opponent's root velocity difference is large enough.

Overall, this code implements a basic reward function for boxing based on distance, knock out success, and time constraints. It can be modified or extended to incorporate additional features of the environment as needed
